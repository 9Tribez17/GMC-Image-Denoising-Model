# GMC-Image-Denoising-Model
A novel denoising model based on generalized minimax concave (GMC) penalty. Meanwhile, methods like alternation direction method of multipliers (ADMM), augmented Lagrange multipliers and soft-thresholding operator are introduced to obtain a clean image, compared with total variation (TV) and total generalized variation (TGV) model.
